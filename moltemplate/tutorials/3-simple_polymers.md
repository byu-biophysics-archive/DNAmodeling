# 3rd Tutorial -- 2 bead heteropolymer

This tutorial is another one of the examples that can be found in the moltemplate github, this time a little bit more complex than the first one. This simulation is of polymers which can simulate proteins. There are two different monomers used in the simulation, each having an "R group" of different material which are attracted to each other. You can see more about this simulation [here](https://github.com/jewettaij/moltemplate/tree/master/examples/coarse_grained/simple_examples/2bead_heteropolymer). Due to the size and computing power needed for this simulation this is a great one to use the supercomputer for. 

## 1st Step -- Setup
You'll find the directory for this simulation in moltemplate/examples/coarse_grained/simple_examples/2bead_heteropolymer. Similarly to the first example you can simply run the given README_setup script to generate the lammps files needed for the simulation. 

## 2nd Step -- Run
You can run the simulation using the README_run file, however note that this simulation may take over 10 hours to run. As said above, this would be a great example to run on the supercomputer. Take a look at the files to make sure you understand the process that went into creating them. 

## 3rd Step -- Visualize
You can use VMD in the same was as we have up to this point to create a simulation of this process. This movie will likely be longer than the others, but should nonetheless be fascinating to watch. If you can get the supercomputer to run VMD and give you back a movie that would be best.

# VMD Basics

Check out the tutorials directory for example ways to run VMD and produce a movie through scripts on the supercomputer. 

## Basics 
* Check out [this great seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jce5JN2fLuo) that goes through a lot of the very basics regarding loading molecules and trajectories into the VMD interface, making movies from the built in Movie Maker extension, as well as running VMD through command-line scripts. 

## Scripting
* In the VMD terminal type "mol help" to get a list of available commands with which you can customize your molecular representation with (ie. drawing method, bond size, trajectory smoothing, etc).
* Check out some more [command-line options](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/vmd-1.7.1/ug/node192.html) here. 

## Movie Making
* Here's a great video about using the VMD interface to customize your [Movie Making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lueqjpjo3yY). Remember you can log your actions to the built in vmd terminal so you know what commands to use in future scripts. 
* Here is a website with useful [hot keys](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/vmd-1.7.1/ug/node30.html) to better navigate the VMD environment.
